      <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigations defines a <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/civil-rights/hate-crimes"> "hate crime"</a> as a offense against a person or group motivated by a bias the offender might have of them (i.e. race, religion, gender, i.e.). The FBI asks various state agencies to submit hate crimes to record incidents that were reported. This chart demonstrates data Florida state agencies submitted that were categorized based on bias motivation. The highest number of incidents in the state in 2016 were incidents motivated by race or ethnicity with 43 reported cases. Incidents motivated by sexual orientation had the second highest number with 31 cases.</p>
